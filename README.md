# Benefits of MQTT API
> One-time authorization. No need to push an authorization token for each request.
> Solid architecture. No need to use different types of API to build your fast panel or dashboard.
> High performance. Good to use on big quantities of requests: you use a single connection with multiple subscriptions.
